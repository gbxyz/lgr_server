    <h1>Root Zone Label Generation Rules for the Hebrew Script</h1>
 
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This file contains a set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the Hebrew script for the Root Zone. 
    For more details on this LGR and additional background on the script, see “Proposal for a Hebrew Script Root
    Zone Label Generation Ruleset (LGR)”, Version 1.3 [Proposal-Hebrew].
    This file is one of a set of LGR files that together form an integrated LGR for the DNS Root Zone [RZ-LGR-5]. 
    The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].</p>

    <h2>Repertoire</h2>
    <p>According to Section 5, “Repertoire” in [Proposal-Hebrew], the Hebrew LGR contains 27 single code points, 5 of which are variants (final forms) of 5 others. 
     The repertoire supports the Hebrew and Yiddish languages with restrictions appropriate for domain names. The repertoire is
     based on [MSR-5], which is a subset of [Unicode 11.0].</p>
      
    <p>The Hebrew script is written from right to left. More details can be found in Section 3, “Background About the Script and Languages Using it” in [Proposal-Hebrew].</p>

    <p>As part of the Root Zone, this LGR includes neither decimal digits nor the HYPHEN-MINUS.</p>
      
    <p>Each code point is tagged with the script or scripts with which the code point is used,
    and one or more references documenting sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire; see “References” below. 
    Comments provide additional information for some code points.</p>

    <p>Code points outside the Hebrew script that are listed in this file are targets
    for out-of-repertoire variants and are identified by a reflexive (identity)
    variant of type “out-of-repertoire-var”. They do not form part of the
    repertoire.</p>

    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>According to Section 6, “Variants”, in [Proposal-Hebrew], this LGR defines five in-script variants, which are final forms of five in-script letters.</p>

    <p><b>Additional Variants:</b> This LGR inherits additional blocked cross-script variants by integration; they may not be listed here unless they result in
    in-script variants. However, for consistency, the variant mappings to ASCII code points are listed in full. See the merged, Common LGR [RZ-LGR-5] 
    for details of all applicable cross-script variants, including any not listed here; always use the Common LGR for determining cross-script collisions of labels.</p>

     <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> All variants are of type “blocked”, making labels that 
     differ only by these variants mutually exclusive: whichever label containing either of 
     these variants is chosen earlier would be delegated, while any other equivalent label should be blocked.</p>

    <p>This LGR does not define allocatable variants.</p>

    <p>The specification of variants in the Root Zone LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>

    <h2>Character Classes</h2>
    <p>The LGR does not define character classes.</p>

    <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
    <h3>Default Whole Label Evaluation Rules and Actions</h3>
    <p>The LGR includes the set of required default WLE rules and actions applicable to the Root Zone and defined in [MSR-5]. They are marked with &#x235F;.</p>
    <h3>Hebrew-specific Rules</h3>
    <p>According to Section 7, “Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) Rules” in [Proposal-Hebrew], the LGR does not define rules specific to the Hebrew script.</p>

    <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
    <p>The Root Zone LGR for the Hebrew script was developed by the Hebrew Generation Panel. For methodology and contributors, see Sections 4 and 8 in [Proposal-Hebrew], as well as [RZ-LGR-5-Overview].</p>
    <p>[IL-IDN] was consulted during the work on this LGR.</p>

    <h3>Changes from LGR-4</h3>

    <p>As result of integration with additional scripts, this LGR has been updated. This update does not change the set of labels available
    under this LGR. For the prior version see [RZ-LGR-4-Hebr]. For consistency across RZ-LGRs, imposed variants to ASCII
    code points, but not to other scripts, are now explicitly listed.
    Additional cross-script variants for this script exist and are defined in [RZ-LGR-5].</p>.
